##
## The controller it replaces was a truncated cone with two slabs stuck on it, and
## every wrong thing about that came from one assumption: that the body is a solid of
## revolution. It is not. Read off a side elevation, the Nunchuk is a LOFT — a stack
## of rings whose front and back reach differ, so the silhouette can scoop in on one
## side while sweeping out on the other. A lathe cannot do that at all; the moment
## the front and back of a station disagree, a cone is the wrong tool.
##
## The shape in words, from the reference elevation:
##
##   * a broad rounded crown carrying the stick, tilted forward,
##   * a deep concave SCOOP down the front face just below the buttons, where the
##     index finger sits — the feature that makes the thing read as a Nunchuk rather
##     than as a handle,
##   * a belly that swells back out into the palm, widest around 45% down,
##   * a long taper to a blunt rounded tail, with the cord leaving dead centre and
##     straight out along the tail's own axis.
##
## The rings interpolate through _PROFILE with a Catmull-Rom, so the table is a dozen
## control stations rather than forty hand-written ones and the surface between them
## is smooth by construction. Each station gives a half-width across X and a SEPARATE
## front and back reach along Z; the ring blends between them as
##
##     z = c * (dm + ds * c)      c = cos(angle), dm = (db+df)/2, ds = (db-df)/2
##
## which hits +db at the back, -df at the front, and passes through zero at the sides
## with a continuous tangent. Taking the front or back radius by a branch on the sign
## of cos — the obvious way — creases the shell down both flanks instead.
##
## Winding is checked the way gen_wii_body.gd checks it: by enclosed volume, on the
## finished solid. An inside-out shell renders as a convincing object you can see
## straight through.

## DOWN-and-out — 40 degrees apart, and both a long way from -55. The Z blade is 20 mm
## long, so getting its rake wrong by that much drove one end 9 mm into the shell and
## stood the other 6 mm off it, which is why the key could be seen from underneath.
