## Nunchuk — the Wii Remote's extension, as a separate object on its own cord.
##
## It never talks to libretro. The remote owns the slot and makes every core call
## for the pair, so this only has to say what its stick and buttons are doing and
## let the remote fold that into the one joypad word it sends. Seating the plug in
## the remote's expansion port is what flips that remote from WIIMOTE to
## WIIMOTE_NC; pulling it out flips it back.
##
## Motion is the one thing it does report on its own account, and even that goes
## out through the remote. libretro addresses one accelerometer per port, so the
## pair's second one rides a sub-device index (see libretro-godot's
## SensorIndex.hpp); the remote reads accel_in_nunchuk_frame() and sends it.

## reads +1g upward rather than nothing, and simply holding it still while the
## room moves cannot register as a jerk.
##
## Driven from _physics_process, and only from there. linear_velocity is the
## physics server's, and a held Nunchuk is a frozen kinematic body the grab
## driver moves on its own physics tick, so this value changes on that clock and
## no other. Differentiated by a render delta it reads a step function off-phase
## and by the wrong divisor — measured at 88 m/s^2 for a brisk 30 cm wave whose

## the remote applies to its own reading — not because the two are
## interchangeable but because both shells are authored the same way up. The
## Nunchuk's stick end is its +Y and its C/Z face is its -Z, so the device's own
## up and forward are Godot's, exactly as the remote's are. Held upright at
## rest this returns (0, 0, 1).
