## Ps1Controller — the original PlayStation pad (SCPH-1080).
##
## Every control animates: the four face buttons, SELECT and START, both shoulder
## pairs, and a rocking D-pad.
##
## That is only possible because of WHICH asset this is. The pad bundled with the
## console scene had its four face buttons, both shoulders and SELECT/START as one
## connected 11,784-triangle surface — a single island, so nothing could be pulled
## out and no button could travel on its own. This shell arrives as 105 disconnected
## islands, which Tools/glb/prepare_ps1_pad.py groups by region and joins into the
## named meshes bound below.
##
## Mapping follows the hardware's own labelling onto the RetroPad: cross is the
## primary button (B), circle A, square Y, triangle X. A PS1 core reads fire off B,
## so cross must be B and not the other way round.

## Measured by ray against the shell beside each cap, not taken from the recess
## depth: the caps stand 1.04 to 1.39 mm proud on both pads, NOT the ~2.6 mm this
## file used to claim. A 1.4 mm throw therefore pushed CIRCLE and TRIANGLE below
## the surface and they vanished at full press. 0.8 mm is a clear press that
## leaves a quarter of a millimetre still standing on the shallowest cap.
const PRESS_FACE: float = 0.0008
## SELECT and START are flush membrane buttons that barely travel, and on the
## DualShock they sit in a recess LOWER than the shell around them, so this is
## half what the face caps get rather than merely less.

## Shoulders hinge more than they sink, but a short straight push reads correctly
## at the scale they are seen from.

## NOT the -Y every other control uses. The shoulders are on the pad's REAR
## VERTICAL FACE, stacked 1 over 2, so pressing them down slides them ALONG that
## face instead of into it -- which is what a straight-down press looked like
## from behind. A finger curls over the top edge and pushes FORWARD, into the
## body, which is +Z here: the cord leaves the far edge on -Z, so the front of
## the pad is +Z.
