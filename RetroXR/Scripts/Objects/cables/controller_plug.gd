## Swap the generic cylinder plug for a device-accurate connector — the PS/2 plugs
## on the keyboard and mouse, the NES pad's 7-pin, the Atari DE-9. The asset is
## authored in this node's own frame (connector on +Z, cable trailing -Z), so it
## needs no transform here.
##
## Takes a PackedScene carrying the shell plus a CordExit marker, or a bare Mesh
## for a connector not converted yet — PlugExit reads either and derives the old
## centre-of-the-back-face answer for the ones that cannot say.
##
## Re-entrant, and it has to be. Every pad sets this once when its cable spawns,
## because a pad is born knowing its console. A PadReceiver is universal and
## learns its connector only when it seats, so it calls this again on every plug
## and unplug — an empty path putting the generic moulding back, which is also
## what an unlisted console gets rather than keeping the last one's connector.
