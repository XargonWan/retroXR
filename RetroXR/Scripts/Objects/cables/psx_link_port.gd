## The serial socket on the back of a PlayStation -- SIO1, the one a link cable
## goes in.
##
## Not the controller bus. That is SIO0, it is on the front, and it carries pads
## and memory cards; the two share a register layout and a name and nothing else.
##
## Subclassed off LinkPort rather than off RcaPort directly, because everything
## this socket needs it already has: finding the machine that owns it by walking
## up the tree, and the core running inside that machine. What differs is the one
## string that decides which plugs fit, and a PlayStation has exactly one of
## these sockets so link_port stays at its default 0.
##
## get_cable() is inherited and always answers null here, which is correct rather
## than merely harmless: it exists so a GBA lead's inline junction can be told
## apart from a socket on a machine, and a PlayStation link cable has no
## junction. Two consoles, one wire, nothing in the middle.

## Whether to draw the silk-screened plate and the SERIAL I/O lettering.
##
## On the primitive body it is the only thing naming the socket, so it defaults
## on. A console with a shell of its own has the legend MOULDED INTO the back
## panel already, and the plate then lands as a black rectangle pasted over the
## console's own print -- so RetroSystemModelPlayStation turns this off, the same
## way it turns off RcaPort.show_jack for sockets the shell already draws.
##
## The dark recess is NOT part of this and stays either way: the shell's own
## socket is bare silver and lights to a bright block under a flat ambient, so
## the darkness that makes it read as a hole has to come from here.
