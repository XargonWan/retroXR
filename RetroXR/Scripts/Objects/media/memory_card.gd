## every game played with this card seated writes into, which is what lets a game
## read the saves other games left behind. No card in the slot means nothing
## persists at all.

## 13 mm above a PlayStation's lid across 90 x 110 mm of it, so pointing at a good
## part of the machine handed you the card instead of the machine. Same treatment
## the cartridge gets, for the same reason.
