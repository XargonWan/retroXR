## RetroSystemModelPCTower — a beige 90s mini-tower PC, the ScummVM "console".
##
## Primitive geometry authored in pc_tower.tscn, deliberately: this exists first to
## prove the SLIDING optical tray, and a box tower takes primitives well (a painted
## steel case is flat panels and square corners, the same reasoning the room's desk
## and wardrobe use). A detailed shell can replace the geometry later without
## touching any of the wiring here.
##
## The tray is the point. Every other disc system in RetroXR is a lidded well —
## MediaTray swings `lid_pivot` about its local X and the disc either stays on the
## spindle or rides a flip-open door. A PC CD-ROM does neither: the tray TRANSLATES
## out of the bay, carrying the disc with it.
##
## That needs no change to MediaTray, because RetroSystem hands lid animation to
## bespoke models via play_open/play_close and only asks the model for
## get_disc_lid_pivot() so the seated disc can be reparented to the moving part.
## So MediaTray keeps owning the gating, seating, spin and collision, and this
## script owns the motion — which happens to be a slide.

# --- hardware description ---------------------------------------------------

## A PC takes keyboard and mouse rather than joypads, but RetroSystem's ports are
## how any input reaches the core, so two are kept — plus the game port, which is
## the one socket here a joypad really did go into.
##
## They stay ORDINARY controller ports: RetroKeyboard and RetroMouse already
## implement the port contract (on_plugged_in / on_unplugged) and spawn the same
## cable a gamepad does. Only the socket geometry and its PC99 colour coding —
## purple keyboard, green mouse, matching the plug meshes — say otherwise.
##
## Seat 3 is the game port. A pad in it drives libretro port 0 whichever cabinet
## slot it occupies, exactly as the mouse does — see RetroSystem._libretro_port_for.
## SystemInfo.native_ports OVERRIDES this number whenever it is set, so the count
## here is only half the story: every computer .tres has to allow three too.

# defaults to -Y, which is right for a button on a top face and wrong for one
# facing you: it sinks the cap down through the bezel instead of into it. The

# between these buttons and the model is identity, and a local write does not

## This tower has two drives, and which one a machine loads from is a property of

## tray, and the other seventeen platforms wearing this tower load from a 3.5 in
## floppy and go in the drive below it.
##

## rest the tray is drawn back into the case, so a cartridge snapped to DiscSeat is
## swallowed by the beige box with nothing to grab. Only a disc system opens that
## tray, which is what makes the well reachable.

## and `slot` lives in the model root's frame. Assigning it raw put the well at the
## tower's base 6 mm under the floor — 36 cm from the tray — so a disc had nothing
## to snap to however far the tray slid out. Compose the pivot's own transform in.
## Its pose is then read back by RetroSystem and re-expressed relative to
## get_disc_lid_pivot(), so it must be set with the tray at its REST pose — which it
## is, since _ready has not moved it.

## and the decks all use — centred on AvAnchor, which is where the captive lead
## used to leave the case: low on the panel and well clear of the PS/2 stack above.
##
## Two conventions, both borrowed rather than derived:
##   * 10 mm PROUD of the panel. rca_port.tscn puts the zone where a seated plug's
##     origin belongs and pushes the jack back by that much so its flange lands on
##     the panel — copy a port's transform and the plug still seats right.
##   * Rotated 180 about X, so each socket's local +Z faces out of the back. That
##     is the same correction PortSeat1/2 carry a few lines above in the scene, and
##     for the same measured reason: a zone at identity yields a plug at
##     diag(1,-1,-1), barrel buried in the case.
##
## Local, like the rest of this model's placement: Back is a bare Node3D at the
