## RetroSystemModelAtari2600 — the six-switch Atari 2600 VCS ("heavy sixer").
##
## Wires POWER and GAME RESET. Both are SLIDE switches, not buttons: thin levers
## that travel up and down the console's 42.5-degree control panel. Driving them
## with the cabinet's generic VRButton sank them into the shell, which is the
## wrong motion and buries the ON/OFF legend printed beside each slot.
##
## The two behave differently on the real hardware and here:
##   POWER  latches. Two detents, and it stays where you put it — VRSlider with
##          steps = 2, via the base class's build_power_slider.
##   RESET  is momentary. Push it and it springs back the instant you let go —
##          VRSpringReturnSlider, firing on the push rather than on a dwell.
## The other four switches (TV Type, Left/Right Difficulty, Game Select) are
## modelled and individually pivoted in the shell but not yet wired.
##
## No eject: 2600 carts pull straight out of the top slot.

## Total switch travel. Measured off the asset rather than guessed: the artist
## modelled Left Difficulty and Game Select thrown down and the other four up,

## Deck envelope, and the shape of its top face.
##
## The top is three surfaces, measured by raycasting the shell's own body mesh
## (one 22.7k-triangle lump, so its AABB says nothing about the shape):
##
##     z -112..-60   raised rear plateau, flat at 87.6 mm
##     z  -60..-20   the control panel, one continuous 41 deg ramp 87.6 -> 53.1
##     z  -20..+112  the ribbed front deck, 53.1 mm
##
## Sample the ramp at x = +/-138 or beyond, NOT at the levers' own x: a ray down
## the lever columns falls through the slots the shell models for them and reads
## 16 mm, which invents a trough across the middle of the panel that is not there.
##
## The ramp is a ConvexPolygonShape3D wedge; a box cannot follow a slope. Taken
## as one straight face it runs up to 2 mm above the real surface in the middle,
## against levers that stand ~5 mm out of it, so they still clear it.
