## NetplayCores — allowlist of libretro cores verified safe for deterministic
## lockstep netplay, plus the deterministic options each one needs.
##
## A core only becomes netplay-capable once it has been vetted with
## Tools/netplay_spike.gd: savestate round-trip AND two cold-started processes
## must produce identical RAM-CRC streams. Cores not listed here fall back to
## the pre-netplay "LIVE on host" placeholder for remote peers.
##
## `options` are forced on every peer at cold start so a peer's local core-option
## config can't introduce divergence (e.g. threaded renderers, frameskip, RNG).

## Debug: let an UNVETTED core start a session anyway.
##
## The allowlist refuses to start rather than risk a silent desync, but the
## session already detects one — periodic RAM CRCs, a savestate resync, three
## strikes to spectator. Refusing to start is belt-and-braces, and it forecloses
## its own evidence: a core cannot be shown deterministic-in-practice if nothing
## may run it. This switch is how a core gets MEASURED before it is listed.
##
## A static, deliberately, and never written to AppPrefs: a debug option that
## survives a restart is one a player can be left stranded in.
