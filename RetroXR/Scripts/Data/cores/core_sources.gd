## CoreSources — cores retroXR ships itself, instead of taking from the buildbot.
##
## Almost every core comes from buildbot.libretro.com and needs nothing here. A
## core lands in this table when we maintain a fork of it, because then the
## buildbot's build is not the one we want the player to have.
##
## Right now that is Dolphin. The buildbot build cannot do Wiimote IR
## passthrough — the frontend hands the emulated camera its real view of the
## sensor bar rather than a cursor position, and the option that switches it on
## only exists in our fork. Without it a Wii Remote in this room points by a
## constant fitted per game; with it, it points where you point.
##
## The binary is published on the fork it was built from, which is also what
## keeps it honest: Dolphin is GPLv2+, so the source for a distributed binary has
## to be there beside it, and a release tag on the source repo is the simplest
## arrangement that stays true.
##
## Deliberately keyed by the SAME core_name the buildbot uses ("dolphin", not
## "dolphin_retroxr"). The frontend derives system/<core> and save/<core> from
## that name, so a new one would strand the Sys folder, every GameCube memory
## card and the whole Wii NAND. Ours replaces the stock build in place and
## inherits all of it.

	# surfaced them, so no frontend could ask for a side-by-side frame. Without
	# that a 3DS in this room is flat, which is the one thing a 3DS is not.

	# Upstream has the change as an open pull request (azahar-emu/azahar#2339).
	# When it merges this entry can go, and the buildbot's build will do.

	# Note the asset has no "_android" infix: azahar's CMake never set an Android
	# OUTPUT_NAME, so its Android core is plain azahar_libretro.so and it is the
	# only one on the buildbot like that. core_lib_suffixes() already accepts
	# both spellings for exactly this core.

	# Play!, the PS2 core. Two of the three fixes are the difference between a
	# core that runs on Quest and one that does not: the buildbot's Android build
	# points its data directory at /sdcard, which scoped storage will not let it
	# create, and the exception that follows escapes retro_init and aborts the
	# whole frontend. Past that, every thread the core starts asked to attach to
	# a JavaVM that a dlopen'd library never receives, and the assert guarding it
	# is compiled out of a release build. The third fix is visible on both
	# platforms — sprites are snapped to whole pixels, closing the column of
	# black seams the GS's corner sampling leaves down an OpenGL-rendered frame.
	#
	# Play! is BSD, so unlike Dolphin the binary carries no source obligation;
	# the fork is where it is built from all the same.
	# mGBA, for the half of the link cable that is not the console.
	#
	# mGBA has carried its own lockstep coordinator for years and it was simply
	# unreachable: nothing in libretro can express a cable, and every core
	# instance is loaded from its own copy of the library, so two Game Boy
	# Advances in one process share no globals and have exactly one thing in
	# common, which is the frontend. Our build talks to a link bus the frontend
	# hosts instead, and that is what makes two handhelds in one room able to
	# play together, single-cartridge play work, and a GameCube lead reach a
	# handheld at all.
	#
	# Unlike Dolphin this is not a GPL obligation -- mGBA is MPL-2.0 -- but the
	# source sits on the tag beside the binary for the same practical reason: it
	# is the only way anyone can tell what they are running.
	#
	# The Android asset DOES carry the "_android" infix, unlike azahar's. Worth
	# saying because the two sit next to each other in this file and the wrong
	# name here fails silently, as a core that simply never downloads.

## Deliberately the /releases/latest/ form and NOT a tagged one. A tag in here

## whole point of having a download manager. GitHub resolves `latest` to the
## newest non-prerelease release, so publishing a build is enough to ship it.
##
## The consequence to know: `latest` is per REPOSITORY, not per product. A
