## Block or release one channel for one owner.
##
## `block_owner` MUST be unique per object whenever more than one object of a
## kind can be holding a block at once. A block is keyed on (channel, owner) and
## `active = false` ERASES that key, so two objects sharing a literal overwrite
## each other -- and because the held peripherals each write BOTH VR channels
## from whichever hand is holding THEM, sharing means the last one to update
## wins and the loser's block is simply gone.
##
## That is not hypothetical: the Wiimote, the TV remote, the light gun and the
## retro controller all passed &"retro_hold" here. Holding a Wiimote and then
## putting down a TV remote erased the Wiimote's block outright, with nothing to
## restore it until the Wiimote itself was re-grabbed -- and all four read their
## own input off that hand's thumbstick, so the player walked while playing.
## They now pass `_vr_block_owner()`, which folds in the instance id.
